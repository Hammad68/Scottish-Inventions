                    The idea of using <b>fingerprinting</b> for use in identifying criminals
                    belongs to Scottish doctor, Henry Faulds, who first suggested it back in 1880. He
                    came up with the idea while working on archaeological digs in Japan and noticing
                    finger prints on shards of ancient pottery.

                    The origins of <b>golf</b> are unclear and much debated. However, it is generally
                    accepted that modern golf developed in Scotland during the Middle Ages. The game did
                    not find international popularity until the late 19th century. It is a highly popular and much loved sport.

                    The breakthrough for the <b>MRI scanner</b> was made by a team working at the
                    University of Aberdeen. It is an incredibly important piece of technology in the medical
                    world, which has had a major impact on how we view the human body. More than 8 billions scans have been completed.

                    Thanks to Sir Alexander Fleming discovery of <b>penicillin</b> he is perhaps one of the best known Scots.
                    His discovery was by accident when returning from a family holiday he found mould growing on a Petri dish.
                    The mould seemed to be stopping bacteria around it from growing. He then realised the mould produced a
                    defense chemical that could kill bacteria.

                    The revolutionary needle is all thanks to Scottish physician, Alexander Wood,
                    who developed the first <b>hypodermic needle</b> in 1853. Wood actually came up with the idea for the device
                    by studying how a bee delivers its sting. These days, the use of hypodermic needles in medicine is common-place.
                    Whether it’s an immunisation, giving blood, or receiving an injection of some kind, countless millions
                    of people around the world have experienced the sharp prick of a hypodermic needle.

                    The  <b>pneumatic tyre</b> was invented by James Boyd Dunop from Ayrshire in 1888. He was
                    actually a veterinary surgeon, running a successful practice. When he attempted to amke a pneumatic tyre
                    for his son's tricycle that gained him and his invention fame. Dunlop's invention was picked up quickly by cyclists.
