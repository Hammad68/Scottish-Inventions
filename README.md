# Scottish-Inventions
This was my first ever group project with my fellow students in my college to make a website.

## My Task
All of our team members were having different responsibilities. And I got the opportunity to become a source specialist to provide all the content of the website such as logos, text, images and videos etc. And I really enjoyed the process of working in a team.
