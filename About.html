                <br> Welcome to our website Scottish Innovations! You will see here just how much we love Scottish inventions and
                we hope you will too! Scots have always had a touch a patriotism and who can blame them, when Scots are known worldwide
                as the bravest of the brave and having a knack for inventing a thing or two, once in a while. With this interest in 
                Scottish history, we look to the wonders of Scottish Innovations. It doesn’t matter where you live in the world, 
                chances are you’ve came by and certainly have come by more than several inventions produced by the lovely Northernly 
                Scots. With so many widely celebrated and famous inventions, we have decided to dedicate our site to this subject.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Many of a great Scot's man has revolutionized the world time after time. With their passion for innovation and 
                imaginative minds which have produced the world we live in now. From disposable eye contact lenses to haggis,
                the Scots have blown away the old style of life with penicillin, tidal energy turbines,  the MRI scanner, the
                telephone and steamboat. The list really does go on and on! It’s pretty fair to say the Scottish inventors,
                invented the modern world we live in now.
            </p>

                Scottish Inventions! We believe it’s always important to remember our history and have an appreciation for the 
                everyday items we use. Can you imagine your life not having a television or using your telephone?  Many daily 
                chores are sped up exponentially by the hard work and years of development and dedication many inventors have 
                taken to produce such items.
